Hey, welcome to some further reading!

Please use the following links for reading on files importing:

- https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-file-handling
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html : this json encoder and decoder library
- https://github.com/tecladocode/complete-python-course/tree/master/course_contents/6_files : working with files on GitHub


There's always more to learn, so I wanted to give you a few resources in case you want to dive deeper into the topic of files in
Python.

Here's a few great or interesting resources:

File Handling Cheat Sheet in Python, a quick cheat sheet for those (frequent) times we forget particular file modes or operations!


Python - Relative imports for the billionth time, another StackOverflow question on relative imports... Do you feel like you could
help this person out now?

19.2. json — JSON encoder and decoder — Python 3.6.4 documentation, the official Python documentation is a great place.
I recommend you read through it when you have doubts about JSON or any other Python topic!

Kind regards,

Jose
